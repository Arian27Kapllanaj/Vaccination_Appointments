### My goal in building this website was to learn the new features and code syntax of Laravel 8 while I already have knowldege in Laravel 6. Also learning Bootstrap 5. So I was a Full-Stack Web Developer in this project, using Laravel as a backend framework and Bootstrap as a frontend framework.Also I learned Agile methodology using Trello and I found a great way to manage the project from start to end.By doing this website I am  more confident using Laravel 8 and Bootstrap 5 and I will always use Agile methodology in my upcoming projects.
